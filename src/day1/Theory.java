/*/*What is Manual Testing?
 * 	Tester manually perform steps on application is Manual Testing.
 * 
 * 	TestCase---> Enter Username,Enter Password,Click Login
 * 
 * 	What is Automation Testing?
 * 	Tools automatically perform steps on an application is automation testing
 * 
 *  Testscript--->When test case is converted in a language of tool is test script
	
 * Manual Testing?

 * 	TestCase---> Enter Username,Enter Password,Click Login
 * 
 * 	What is Automation Testing?
 * 	Tools automatically perform steps on an application is automation testing
 * 
 *  Testscript--->When test case is converted in a language of tool is test script

*  Limitation of Manual Testing
 *  1]	Takes more resources
 *  2]	Takes more time
 *  3]	Human errors are introduced
 *  4]	Not reliable
 *  5]	Performance testing is not possible manually

 *  5]	Performance testing is possible
functional testing, let us check whether website
 *  					works as intended when accessed on different browsers 
 *  6]	Cross Platform Testing--->Application work on multiple web & mobile platform..Part 
 *  					of quality assurance process 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 *
*  Limitation of Manual Testing
*  Advantages of Automation Testing
*  Which test case we will put in automation testing
 *  Which test case we will not put in automation testing
 *  1]	Test case which are not tested manually atleast once
 *  2]	Test case for which requirements are changing frequently

*  Testing Tools--->
 *  1]	Test Management tool---> JIRA,TESTLINK,TARANTULA
 *  2]	Defect reporting tool---> MANTIS,BUGZILLA,REDMINE,JIRA
 *  3]	Functional Testing tool-->SELENIUM,QTP[UFT],RFT
 *  4]	Performance testing tool-->JMETER,LOADRUNNER				

* 	Selenium:-
 * 	1]	free & open source
 * 	2]	designed to test web application
 * 	3]	support multiple browser----->chrome,firefox,edge,safari,IE
 * 	4]	support multiple language---->Java,python,ruby,c#,javascript
 * 	5]	support multiple platform---->wins,linux,mac

 * 	QTP[UFT]-->Quick Test Professional[Unified functional testing]
 * 	1]	Paid source
 * 	2]	language---> vbscript
 * 	3]	platform-->wins
 * 	4]	browser-->chrome & firefox
 * 
 *  Selenium Suite--->Four Components
 *  
 *  1]	Selenium IDE[Integrated Development Environment]
 *  2]	Selnium RC[Remote Control]
 *  3]	Selenium Grid
 *  4]	WebDriver


* Birth of Selenium--->Jasson HUggins in 2006 ---> JAVASCRIPTTESTRUNNER--->SELENIUM CORE
 * 
 * SAME ORIGIN POLICY--->install whole AUT & web server on local system
 * 					A javascript program can only access pages on same domain
 * 					cannot access from different domains

* Selenium RC---> PAUL HAMMANT--->HTTP PROXY to "TRICK" the browser into believing
 * 				that selenium core & web application being tested on same domain
 * 
 * Selenium Grid--->PATRICK LIGHTBODY--->running multiple test across different
 * 				browser & different OS in PARALLEL.Selenium Grid uses HUB & NODE
 * 				concept where we run test on SINGLE machine called as HUB but
 * 				execution is done on DIFFERENT machine called as NODE

*  Selenium IDE--->SHINYA KASATANI...record & playback
 *  				available as firefox plugin & chrome plugin
 *  	
 *  		Limitation of IDE
 *  		Does not support OOPS concept
 *  		DOES not support database & spread sheet
 *  
 *  WebDriver--->SIMON STEWART--->First platform testing framework that could control browser
 *  			from OS level.WebDriver directly communicates with web browser to automate
 *  			the application.
